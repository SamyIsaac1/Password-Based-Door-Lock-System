we have here two micros which are talkin' with each other through SPI
-The Master sends the data from keypad and display it on LCD
-The Slave makes all mathematics and compares the data he's received from the Master with The Data in EEPROM
Than sends a signal to generate INR in Master Micro to tell him if the Password is true or wrong
